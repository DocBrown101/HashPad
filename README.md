## Usage

 - To send a file to be compared from `Send to` of Explorer's context menu, open the menu by tapping hamburger button and check `Add to 'Send to' of Explorer's context menu`. Or drag and drop a file to the window. Or  select a file from file dialog.
 - Paste a string of expected value in `Expected Value`. Or read it directly from clipboard.
 - If the computed hash value matches the expected value, `Match` message will appear.

## Uninstall

Before uninstalling, if you checked `Add to 'Send to' of Explorer's context menu`, uncheck it to remove the shortcut in `Send to` folder. It can be done by `Remove from 'Send to'` in the jump list as well.
